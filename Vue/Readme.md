## Folder Structure To Start With

<pre>
src/
|-- assets/                # Static assets like images, fonts, css, js, vendor etc.
|
|-- components/            # Reusable Vue components
|   |-- common/            # Common components (e.g., buttons, inputs)
|   |-- layout/            # Layout components (e.g., header, footer)
|
|-- views/                 # Vue components representing pages/views
|   |-- Home.vue           # Example: Home page
|   |-- About.vue          # Example: About page
|
|-- router/                # Vue Router configuration
|   |-- index.js           # Router setup and route definitions
|
|-- store/                 # Vuex store modules
|   |-- index.js           # Vuex store setup
|   |-- moduleA.js         # Example: Vuex module A
|   |-- moduleB.js         # Example: Vuex module B
|
|-- App.vue                # Root Vue component
|-- main.js                # Entry point for Vue app

The `store folder` in a Vue.js application is typically used for implementing state management using Vuex. Vuex is a state management pattern and library for Vue.js applications that helps manage the data that needs to be shared across multiple components. It's especially useful for managing complex application states, making communication between components more efficient, and handling asynchronous operations.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the purpose of the store folder:

State Management: In Vue applications, components communicate with each other by passing data through props and events. However, as your application grows, managing the state of different components can become challenging. Vuex provides a centralized store where you can keep your application's state.

Centralized State: The store folder typically contains Vuex store modules. These modules store the application's state in a single location, making it easier to track changes and maintain consistency across different components.

Actions and Mutations: In Vuex, you define actions to perform asynchronous operations and mutations to modify the state. Actions are used to trigger mutations, which update the state. This separation allows you to keep business logic and state changes separate.

Getters: Vuex getters are used to retrieve computed values from the state. They can be thought of as computed properties for the Vuex store.

Here's a simplified example of how the store folder might be structured:
<pre>
src/
|-- store/
|   |-- index.js            # Vuex store setup
|   |-- moduleA.js          # Example: Vuex module A
|   |-- moduleB.js          # Example: Vuex module B
</pre>
In this example, index.js is the entry point to configure the Vuex store, and moduleA.js and moduleB.js are Vuex store modules. Each module might define state, mutations, actions, and getters specific to its functionality.

For instance, if you have components that need to share user authentication state, shopping cart data, or other global data, Vuex can help manage and synchronize these states effectively.

Overall, the store folder in a Vue.js application is a place to manage and centralize the application's state using the Vuex library, enabling a more organized and scalable approach to handling complex data interactions in your application.
